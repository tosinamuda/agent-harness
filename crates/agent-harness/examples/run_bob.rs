//! Run a prompt against the bob adapter and stream the normalized events.
//!
//! `BOBSHELL_API_KEY=… cargo run --example run_bob --features bob`
//!
//! Doubles as the live regression check for the node-pairing fix: run it
//! with an incompatible node deliberately leading the PATH —
//!
//! ```sh
//! PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.2/bin:$PATH" \
//!   BOBSHELL_API_KEY=… cargo run --example run_bob --features bob
//! ```
//!
//! Pre-fix, bob (installed under a v24 nvm dir) was re-exec'd on the v20
//! node leading the inherited PATH and died with
//! `bad option: --disable-sigusr1` — surfacing only as "exited with code 9".
//! With the fix, `spawn_bob` resolves bob's absolute install dir and the
//! engine prepends it to the child PATH, so bob runs on its sibling node and
//! the answer streams normally regardless of the launch environment's PATH.
