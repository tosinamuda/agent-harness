//! The neutral harness contract: the [`Harness`] trait, the run-control
//! handle, the neutral request/metadata types, and the shared
//! interactive-login helper.
//!
//! A *harness* is whatever actually answers the user's prompt — a CLI
//! agent (bob / Claude Code / Codex today), a direct LLM API tomorrow,
//! some other runner after that. A consumer only needs to: probe whether
//! a harness is ready, run a one-time install if required, stream a run,
//! and know which credential to ask for. This module is that seam.
//!
//! ## Design rules
//!
//! - **Object-safe trait.** Consumers hold `Box<dyn Harness>`; no
//!   generics leak across the seam.
//! - **Arc callbacks, not generic closures.** Streaming methods take
//!   `Arc<dyn Fn(..) + Send + Sync>` so they stay object-safe and can be
//!   cloned onto the reader threads the subprocess engine uses.
//! - **Normalize at the adapter, not the UI.** The event enums in
//!   [`crate::events`] are harness-neutral by intent; each adapter
//!   translates its CLI's wire format into them so the front-end consumes
//!   one shape regardless of which harness produced it.

// --- Errors ---------------------------------------------------------

/// A boxed, type-erased error source. The [`HarnessError`] variants carry one
/// of these instead of `#[from]`-ing a single concrete type, because each
/// *category* can be produced by more than one underlying error: a `Spawn`
/// failure is a [`cli_stream::StreamError`] for the claude/codex adapters but a
/// `bob_rs::BobError` for bob. The real error stays reachable through
/// [`std::error::Error::source`] (and `downcast_ref`); the category is the
/// variant.
pub type BoxError = Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static>;

/// Why a [`Harness`] operation failed. Returned by `install` / `run` /
/// `login` / [`RunControl::cancel`] so a consumer can branch on the *kind* of
/// failure — offer install vs sign-in vs surface the message — instead of
/// string-matching.
///
/// Each category carries the real underlying error as a [`source`] (via the
/// [`BoxError`] field), so a consumer that wants more than the category can
/// walk `.source()` or `downcast_ref::<cli_stream::StreamError>()` /
/// `::<bob_rs::BobError>()`. The `Display` still flattens the source into the
/// message (`"failed to start the agent: <source>"`), so a consumer that just
/// stringifies at a boundary (e.g. a Tauri command's `.to_string()`) gets the
/// same full message as before. `#[non_exhaustive]` so adding a variant later
/// isn't a breaking change.
